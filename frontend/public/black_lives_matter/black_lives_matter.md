# Black lives matter

As we approach the chaotic weeks that will define the 
“2020 football season,” let us not forget the movements 
of the offseason. I firmly believe that you cannot be both 
a football fan and a racist while maintaining any claim to 
being an honest person. In a sport where the vast majority 
of players are people of color, if you feel any ounce of 
superiority compared to the people on the field because of 
the color of your skin, please reflect on your morals. 

The NFL is composed [over 70% people of color](https://qz.com/1287915/the-nfls-racial-makeup-explains-much-of-its-national-anthem-problems/). 
College football teams [average 57% people of color](https://time.com/4110443/college-football-race-problem/). 

The issues of systemic racism plaguing our country are not a 
separate issue from the sport we know and love. These players 
do not leave their identities and the weight of societal 
inequities behind when they put their pads on. 

I do not 
believe Tom Herman and I have a lot in common aside from a 
desire to see the Sooners lose, but I think he said it best 
when [he stated](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29269030/longhorns-coach-tom-herman-join-protests-george-floyd-death):
>“And if you're going to cheer them and love them for 3½ 
hours a Saturday in the fall, you better have the same 
feelings for them off the field, because they're human 
beings. They deserve the same amount of respect and human 
rights that all of us do in this country when we agreed on 
the social contract to be a member of the United States." 

As you watch this season, and all those that follow, 
please keep these issues at the forefront of your tailgate 
conversations, halftime chats and all other thoughts and words surrounding 
the game. As fans from all teams, we can unite on this common 
ground and fight for the true victory that is a safe and 
equitable America for all.
