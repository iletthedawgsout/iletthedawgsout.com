        Hi all - thanks for visiting my blog! I am a current Masters of Data Science student at the University of
        Washington, where I also got my undergraduate degrees in Informatics and Oceanography, so it is safe to say I
        bleed purple and gold. As a second generation husky and semi-professional tailgater, I love all things data and
        husky football, and this site is my spot to explore those passions. I love all types of feedback and football
        banter so feel free to reach out at wwtara@hotmail.com. Enjoy and Go Dawgs!
    </p>
